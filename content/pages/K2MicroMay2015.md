The [NASA K2 mission](http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2/) makes use of the Kepler spacecraft to expand upon Kepler's groundbreaking discoveries in the fields of exoplanets and astrophysics through new and exciting observations. K2 uses an innovative way of operating the spacecraft by carefully balancing the pressure of photons coming from the Sun. The K2 mission offers long-term, simultaneous optical observation of thousands of objects at high precision. 



The K2 observation plan is to execute [standalone campaigns](http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2/Fields.shtml) lasting approximately 75 days. [Campaign 9](http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2/Fields.shtml#9) will begin in April, 2016 and will observe a region of the sky in the direction of the Galactic bulge. Campaign 9 will differ from every previous campaign because (a) it will be dedicated to the detection of gravitational microlensing events and (b) the spacecraft boresight will point toward the direction of motion.

To support Campaign 9 activities [NASA is soliciting proposals](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?method=init&solId={980F0800-B319-53B1-A46D-EBF2E0BBE599}&path=open) to join a Microlensing Science Team. This team, consisting of approximately 5 to 10 members, will coordinate with and make recommendations to the K2 GO office and K2 project regarding the observational planning of Campaign 9. The intention is to form a cohesive team that can work to represent and serve the best interests of the microlensing scientific community. Proposals are expected to address one or more of the specific areas of work relevant to the exploitation of K2 microlensing experiment data. 

The purpose of this workshop is to discuss plans for the K2 microlensing experiment, particularly focusing on ground-based observing plans. NASA HQ and K2 staff will present information regarding the proposal process, possible programs and budgets.
